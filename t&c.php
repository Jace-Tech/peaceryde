                                    The General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) is one of the most significant pieces of legislation affecting the way that PeaceRyde Africa carries out its information processing activities.

It is PeaceRyde Africa policy to ensure that our compliance with the GDPR and other relevant legislation is clear and demonstrable at all times.

                                </p>

                                      PeaceRyde Africa will ensure that it complies with all of these principles both in the processing it currently carries out and as part of the introduction of new methods of processing such as new IT system.

                                    Unless it is necessary for a reason allowable in the GDPR, PeaceRyde Africa will always obtain explicit consent from a data subject to collect and process their data. In case of children below the age of 16 (a lower age may be allowable in specific EU member states) parental consent will be obtained. Transparent information about our usage of their personal data will be provided to data subjects at the time that consent is obtained and their rights with regard to their data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent. This information will be provided in an accessible form, written in clear language and free of charge.

                                    If the personal data is required to be collected and processed in order to comply with the law, then explicit consent is not required. This may be the case for some data related to employment and taxation for example, and for many areas addressed by the public sector.

                                    In a case where the personal data are required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, then this may be used as the lawful basis of the processing. PeaceRyde Africa will retain reasonable, documented evidence that this is the case, whenever this reason is used as the lawful basis of the processing of personal data. As an example, this may be used in aspects of social care, particularly in the public sector.

In line with the GDPR, where a breach is known to have occurred which is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the relevant supervisory authority will be informed within 72 hours.

We will not use your data for any other purpose incompatible with the original purpose unless you first give us your consent or we are compelled by law to do so.
                                </p>

                                    We ensure that the personal data you give us is correct and not misleading. We achieve this by giving you the opportunity to confirm the information you give us and also by requesting documentary proof when necessary.

                                    vii. Personal data security 
                                    Your personal data are held in a very secure environment both physically and technically. The areas where personal data are kept are out of bounds for all non-authorised persons. Access to these parts of the premises can only be gained by electronic key issued only to authorised persons. Your personal data can only be accessed on the system by authorised persons. Only such authorised persons can alter, disclose or destroy your personal data. Further, such authorised persons can only carry out any of those functions in the course of their lawful duties. Therefore, the chances of your personal data being unlawfully processed or accidentally damaged, destroyed or lost are very minimal. Further, it is our policy to ensure that:
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                    viii. Transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area 
                                    Your personal data will not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. There are only few counties outside the EEA that have been accepted as having adequate levels of protection for the processing of personal data comparable to the EEA countries. When we are transferring personal data to the USA, we ensure that the recipient is a signatory to the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbour Scheme. This scheme is recognised by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for data subjects. In relation to other countries outside the EEA that have not been accepted as having equivalent security and safeguards in place for processing personal data, we either sign a separate contract, the terms of which are approved by the European Directives or ensure that there is a clause in the contract that protects the processing of personal data of all our clients.
