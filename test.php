        <p class="caption"><span class="caption-subhead">THE PROBLEM: </span>As viewport narrows, the first short words will stick to the top of the floated image, while the rest of the text moves below.<p>

        <p>'If I had been immaculate whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"' 'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' 'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise. 'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"' 'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p>

        <p class="caption"><span class="caption-subhead">SOLUTION #1 IS HYPHENATION 
          <br>see last css rule { hyphens: auto; } which needs language defined on parent element (lang="en")</span>
          <br>Allow hyphenation to break up the words to fit the column even as it narrows. This is not perfect â€” at some narrow widths "If I" or "If I had" will stick to top while the rest of the text gets pushed below the image, though that can be cured with breakpoints.<p>

      <p class="caption">Can combine the two solutions. Also can insert soft hyphens manually to tweak hyphenation. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/hyphenate/</p>
